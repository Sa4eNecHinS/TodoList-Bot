# TODO LIST BOT

A simple bot for adding/deleting/viewing tasks with a user-friendly interface.


## FIRST BOT

It should be noted that this is my first bot that I wrote myself. And the purpose of this repository is not to showcase my bot, but just to try to get it published, to work with github. (I had other projects before this one, but those I wrote in github itself, not uploaded from my computer).


## HINTS

As I said earlier this is my first bot, so I'm sure I've made a lot of mistakes. And I will take comments well if they are explained.

 For example:

 - you have a lot of shit from line 30-40 of the code in that file.  - It's a total hate, I'm not going to react to such a thing.

- you have a lot of shit from line 30-40 of the code in that file. You should have written like this/better use this.  - Great comment and good point.
